      <h2> The Challenge </h2>
        <p> Young people want places to go. In Islington, they have a number of options, but few of them are free. Community centres in estates have been closed, or are being redeveloped. Many don’t feel safe travelling to the places which remain open because of high incidence of crime or antisocial behaviour. Prospex gives them somewhere to learn, play, or just relax – closer to home. </p>
<p>Our youth hubs offer a safe space for young people to meet new people, learn new skills, and enjoy themselves in an environment designed to promote positive wellbeing. We have a ‘Healthy Bodies, Healthy Minds’ approach – stimulating both the physical body, and the mind. We run regular cooking, gardening, arts and crafts, team building, and personal development sessions, coupled with sports, physical activity and trips to the countryside.</p>
<p>Whatever they feel like doing, whoever they are, and whoever they wish to be, we want every young person to find a home at Prospex. </p>

      <h2> What We Do </h2>

        <h3> Street Teams </h3>
            <!-- <h4> Problem: </h4>
              <p>Islington lacks interesting, engaging, open, free spaces for young people to spend their time outside. In certain instances, young people become entrenched in gang culture and unwilling to move into new, unfamiliar spaces because of shyness, wariness, or safety issues. </p>
            <h4>What we offer: </h4>
              <p>Our Street Teams exist to make sure young people are safe and well, wherever they are. If they’d rather not come to the centre, our staff check in on them in their local area. This builds a mutual trust and allows positive relationships to be formed. Our team become familiar faces, and get to know the wider community as well as the young people themselves. </p>
              <p>Being a visible presence on the streets and building relationship with young people in public also helps dispel the myth that young people aren’t approachable, or are out to cause trouble. Our teams has been able to diffuse volatile situations on the streets amongst young people and their communities. Early interventions like this help improve relationships amongst different groups and generations in the areas we work in, as well as the young people themselves. </p>
            <h4>Outcomes: </h4>
              <p>Our joint Street Team and Youth Work Centre Based approach has had positive impacts by helping to reduce anti social behaviour in localised areas. Our Street Teams have also helped young people back into work, education and apprenticeships. </p> -->

        <h3> One 2 One </h3>
            <!-- <h4> Problem: </h4>
              <p>Many schools do not have the resources to offer learning mentors or individual support for young people. Often, neither do their parents. Growing up is hard enough; if they see their families struggling and their own prospects feel bleak, it is even harder. Worry can turn to frustration and quickly, to anger: this can lead to poorer attainments at school, or cause harm to their mental health. </p>
            <h4> What we offer: </h4>
              <p>We allocate young people a Dedicated One2One worker based on their needs and circumstances. Our One2one work could range from a few sessions helping a young person complete a application form, to many years working with them and their families to help overcome a range of complex issues which, together, can have a serious impact on their wellbeing. </p>
              <p>Most of our One2One referrals come from our own work streams. As such, we can start from a place of mutual respect and not have to spend multiple sessions getting to know the young person and building trust.	</p>
            <h4> Outcomes: </h4>
              <p>Through regular one-to-one sessions with their personal worker, young people have a constant in their life – someone who will listen to them, encourage them, raise their aspirations and give them the confidence to overcome what is holding them back from reaching their potential. Our flexible approach allows our workers to meet and communicate with their young person whenever suits both parties, even if this means meeting outside of the normal arranged times. </p> -->

      <h2> Why We're Different </h2>
      <p>Our team does more than just meet and engage with young people within the confines of the centre. </p>
      <p>We have been advocates for our children and teens with school, the police, and other authorities.  We meet with parents and their peers to help mediate conflicts, and accompany them to meetings or important appointments to provide support. If we feel their voices are not being heard, we speak up, and encourage them to do the same. We listen when they need us to, and signpost them to other organisations where necessary. </p>
      <p>Our team and volunteers build lasting, meaningful relationships with the young people who come to us. We let them be themselves and engage in positive activities designed to promote and stimulate healthy bodies and healthy minds. </p>
