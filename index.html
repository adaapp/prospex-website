            <h1>The Challenge</h1>
            <p>There are two sides to Islington.</p>
            <p>The leafy mansions of the upper middle classes â€“ and the low-income households in which a third of under-sixteens live.</p>
            <p>In one in three Islington households, no-one is employed. Over half of single parents in the borough â€“ mostly mothers â€“ are out of work. Just a fifth are in full employment, half the national average.</p>
            <p>The borough has the highest recorded prevalence of depression and severe mental illness in London. </p>
            <p>It is highly overpopulated, with triple as many people per square metre as the average London borough, and the second lowest proportion of green space. 
            Itâ€™s also full of young people with drive, creativity, ideas â€“ and enormous potential. But without safe green spaces, playgrounds, or youth centres, they have nowhere to grow. And without the financial freedom to travel to other areas of the city, they cannot benefit from better local provisions elsewhere. We donâ€™t want their energy and ambitions to go to waste.</p>

            <h1>What we do</h1>
            <p>Young people want places to go. In Islington, they have a number of options, but few of them are free. Community centres in estates have been closed, or are being redeveloped. Many donâ€™t feel safe travelling to the places which remain open because of high incidence of crime or antisocial behaviour. Prospex gives them somewhere to learn, play, or just relax â€“ closer to home. </p>
            <p>Our youth hubs offer a safe space for young people to meet new people, learn new skills, and enjoy themselves in an environment designed to promote positive wellbeing. We have a â€˜Healthy Bodies, Healthy Mindsâ€™ approach â€“ stimulating both the physical body, and the mind. We run regular cooking, gardening, arts and crafts, team building, and personal development sessions, coupled with sports, physical activity and trips to the countryside. </p>
            <p>Whatever they feel like doing, whoever they are, and whoever they wish to be, we want every young person to find a home at Prospex. </p>

            <h1>Why Weâ€™re Different</h1>
            <p>Our team does more than just meet and engage with young people within the confines of the centre. </p>
            <p>We have been advocates for our children and teens with school, the police, and other authorities.  We meet with parents and their peers to help mediate conflicts, and accompany them to meetings or important appointments to provide support. If we feel their voices are not being heard, we speak up, and encourage them to do the same. We listen when they need us to, and signpost them to other organisations where necessary.</p>
            <p>Our team and volunteers build lasting, meaningful relationships with the young people who come to us. We let them be themselves and engage in positive activities designed to promote and stimulate healthy bodies and healthy minds. </p>
